            <h2>The Story of Lavender Sweet</h2>
            <p>
                Lavender Sweet was born from small moments — the kind where you discover your strength 
                without even noticing it. It started as a simple spark, a soft idea in the back of the mind… 
                but grew into a brand shaped by passion, creativity, and quiet determination. Every product is 
                made with intention: to bring warmth, beauty, and a touch of softness into someone’s day.
            </p>

            <h2>Lavender Sweet Values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> staying true to who you are, even when no one’s watching.</li>
                <li><strong>Quality with Heart:</strong> every detail matters, every flavor has a story.</li>
                <li><strong>Comfort & Calm:</strong> bringing the gentle feeling of lavender into every experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> reminding people that strength often shows in the smallest things.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How It All Started</h2>
            <p>
                It began with a love for creating little things that make people smile — gifts, mixes, sweets, and moments. 
                What started as a hobby slowly turned into a passion project… then a growing brand. 
                Lavender Sweet became a space where creativity meets comfort, and where every product carries a part of your personality.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h2>Our Message  Personal Touch</h2>
            <p>
                Lavender Sweet is more than a brand — it’s a reminder. A reminder that strength grows quietly, 
                that beauty can be simple, and that kindness can be handmade. 
                My personal touch lies in making every piece feel meaningful, warm, and thoughtful. 
                I want each sweet, each mix, each gift to carry the message: 
                <strong><br/>“There’s power inside you — even when you don’t notice it.” SARA💜</strong>
